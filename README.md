for Logitech G933 headsets, toggle volume levels of each application without modifying the system volume.

I absolutely Love the G933, and the fact that I can connect my phone to the adapter and take calls while gaming without removing the headphones.
however, I figured that the windows system volume also controls the volume of the aux input, which is so dumb.
so, I have made an exe. It basically reduces the volume of all the apps running on windows to 10% without changing the system volume. the next time you run the exe, it brings back the 10% of each application to 100%.
now, just the exe is not impressive, I have bound one of the G keys on the headset itself to run the exe using Logitech gaming software.

Whenever I want to receive a call, i just press the Gkey. and press it again when the call ends. no need to stop my gaming session!
